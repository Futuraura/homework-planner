# Hello world!
This is my first project that is made to make my life as well as life of people who cannot properly remember that they have homework or other stuff to do and they do it in the last second.
This tool is made to aid in those kind of situations.

## How do I use this thing?
1. First you host it somewhere, I am gonna host it later for myself and for you all using cookies as a database for this.
2. Next, you have to input today or the date that the assignment was given and then input the due date when you have to return the assignment.
3. After that you start adding the assignments that you need to spread out throughout the time period by clicking the "Add Assignment" button.
4. A new box with the assignment details has appeared where you need to type in your Assignment name for example "English" and then the details for example "Task 1 from chapter 2" and you need to create a new box for each task for it to spread it out properly.
5. Once you're done you have to click "Plan my homework!" and the dates that have tasks in them will appear on the calendar in red color. 
6. **WRITE DOWN THE DATES AND THE TASKS THERE IS NO SAVE SYSTEM CURRENTLY IN PLACE**

## I want to help!
Thank you so much for your help I will gladly accept it, fork the repo and create a pull request and explain why you want this to be added into code.
This script is in beta and any kind of help will be greatly appriciated.

P.S I hope this will help someone with bad memory like it helps me.
